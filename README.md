# Finnish EOD stock data

This end-of-day data is straight out of the public NASDAQ API. Public API does not provide longer than 10 years of data. So even though Nokia and others have been around a lot longer, you will see the data being cut off at November 15th 2015. 

File names are the NASDAQ orderbook IDs. To see the corresponding stock names, refer to the names.json file.
